This is my website to show some of my stuff I made, there's also stuff in my website, just check it out at https://linerly.github.io/

Uses HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. (though I plan to get rid of JavaScript entirely)

If you're wondering how did I implement the PWA feature, I use [Workbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox).
