This is my website to show some of my stuff I made, just check them out at https://linerly.github.io/

Uses HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. (though I will plan to get rid of JavaScript entirely - or not, just trying out things like PWA)

If you're wondering how did I implement the PWA feature, I used [Workbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox).
